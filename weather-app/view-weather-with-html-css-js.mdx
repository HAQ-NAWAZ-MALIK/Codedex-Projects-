**Read Time:** 60 minutes

## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how some apps and sites let you check the weather?

In this tutorial, we're going to learn to build a web app that displays the current weather, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a special ingredient... APIs!

With the power of [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) and a bit of coding magic, we can check the weather by location.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have learned to utilize the following:

- Fetching asynchronous data with API secrets/keys.
- Organizing content with a CSS layout model.
- Changing what's on the rendered page.

The finished weather will look and work like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/finished_weather_app.gif" alt="Finished Weather Application" />

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Project Setup

First, we'll need to create the folders and files that will hold the code for our project. Let's begin by opening a terminal and creating a new folder named **weather-app** using the `mkdir` command. Then, go into this folder by using the `cd` command:

```
mkdir weather-app
cd weather-app
touch index.html styles.css index.js
```

This will create the following files in the **weather-app** folder:

- An **index.html** file to render the application.
- A **styles.css** file for customizing the appearance of our application.
- An **index.js** file where we will fetch our weather data.

We will return to these files later on. But for now, let's head over to OpenWeather!

## Step 2: Get API Key From OpenWeather

OpenWeather provides several APIs (or application programming interfaces) that feature interesting weather-related data. 

If you haven't already, you must create an OpenWeather account with a username, email, and password:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/new_open_weather_account_form.png" alt="Form for new account with OpenWeather" />

**Note:** You'll be sent a verification email; make sure to answer it!

Next, you'll be prompted to state what you want to do with OpenWeather's API.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/open_weather_account_prompt.png" alt="Prompt by OpenWeather (post-login)" />

I recommend choosing “Education/Science" or “Other".

You should now be ready to view your API key! After creating a new account, a new key should be generated for you. Near the top right, select your username, followed by “My API keys" in the dropdown:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/open_weather_api_key.gif" alt="Screen for generating new keys for OpenWeather API" />

After confirming you have an active API key, let's move on to the next step!

## Step 3: Write HTML

It's time to start writing some code!

Let's return to our code editor and re-open the **index.html** file.

Add the following HTML to start:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  <title>Weather App</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```

Aside from the necessary `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, we've included a `<link>` element in the `<head>` to connect our HTML with our **styles.css** file (which we'll work on in the next step).

Next, let's add the following HTML inside the `<body>` element:

```html
<body>
<main>
  <section id="weather-wrapper">
    <h1>Weather App</h1>
    <div id="weather-search">
     <input id="search" type="text" placeholder="Search by city" />
      <input id="submit" type="submit" onclick="fetchWeather()" value="Search" />
    </div>
    <div id="weather-data" style="display: none;"></div>
  </section>
  </main>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

The `<main>` element will hold all of our app structure, which includes a heading followed by two `<section>` elements:

- One contains `<input>` elements that include an event listener, which activates a function when something happens to the element, such as being clicked (i.e., `onclick="fetchWeather()"`). 
- The other one is empty for now, but will eventually be populated with weather data when we write the `fetchWeather()` event listener later on in this tutorial.

We also added a `<script>` element to connect our HTML with the **script.js** file.

**Note:** The `<script>` element is written before the closing `</body>` tag to ensure all of the HTML is loaded and can be worked with by JavaScript.

If we save the **index.html** file and open it on the browser, it should look like this:


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/rendered_weather_app_html_only.png" alt="Rendered Weather App (HTML only)" />

It's looking pretty bare-bones right now. But not to worry! We'll take care of that in the next step.

## Step 4: Write CSS

Let's add a little pizazz to our weather app by styling it with CSS!

For the most part, this step will feature plain CSS. However, we will also be using a fun layout model for CSS called Flexbox to better position our application content.


Inside of our **styles.css**, let's begin by adding the following:

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  background-image: url(https://www.travellens.co/content/images/size/w2000/format/webp/2022/06/Dumbo-NYC.jpg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

Here's what we did in the snippet above:

- First, we're selecting everything (i.e., `*`), defaulting the `margin` and `padding` to zero, and factoring the `padding` and `border` into element sizes with `box-sizing: border-box`.
- Then, we're making the `body` as tall as the screen on which it is rendered with `100vh`. We're also setting its `font-family` information, with a default `sans-serif` font.
- Lastly, we are setting a `background-image` by passing a PNG file of Brooklyn (where Codédex is based) to the `url()` function. Feel free to use your own image, though!

Next, we're gonna select the `<main>` element and add the following styles:

```css
main {
  background-color: rgba(227, 193, 173, 0.85);
  position: relative;
  top: 30%;
  border: 1px solid;
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 2em;
  width: 45%;
  margin: auto;
}

h1 {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

Starting from the top, we did the following:

- We added a `background-color` with RGB values, as well as a fourth value that makes the `<main>` element 85% "see-through."
- The `<main>` element was placed 30% from the `top` of the screen after being set with `position: relative`.
- We added some box layer settings,  including `border`, `border-radius`, and `padding`, to the `<main>` element..
- Since the `<main>` element is a block element, we centered it with a `width` of 40% and `margin: auto`. 
- Lastly, we added some space below the `h1` element with `margin-bottom`.

If we save our **styles.css** file at this point, our rendered weather app should look like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/rendered_weather_app_with_css_1.png" alt="Rendered app with some CSS" />

Now, let's make the `<input>` elements appear larger to better match the `<h1>` heading above them. Select these elements with `#search` and `#submit`, and add the following:

```css
#search {
  border-radius: 5px 0 0 5px;
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 16px;
  width: 70%;
  height: 50px;
  border: none;
}

#submit {
  border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 16px;
  width: 5em;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

Both of these elements get the same styles for `border-radius`, `padding`, and `font-size`.

The `#search` element gets a 50% `width`, as well as a `height` of `50px` and no `border`.

The `#submit` element gets a `width` of `10em`, along with a `cursor: pointer` style that makes the arrow turn into a pointing hand while hovering above this element.

Let's save **styles.css** and re-render the page:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/rendered_weather_app_with_css_2.png" alt="Rendered app with more CSS added" />

Next, we're going to apply some CSS Flexbox to easily center-align the content in our weather app.

Inside the `#weather-wrapper` and `#weather-search` elements, let's add the following:

```css
#weather-wrapper {
  display: flex;
}

#weather-search {
  display: flex;
}
```

Since both `#weather-wrapper` and `#weather-search` contains child elements, `display: flex` turns them into flex containers. The elements in these containers become flex items that we can align with certain properties.

Go ahead and add the following:

```css
#weather-wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  place-items: center;
}

#weather-search {
  display: flex;
  width: 50%;
}
```

By default, flex items are displayed in a row. But we changed this for the `#weather-wrapper` element by setting `flex-direction` to `column`.

To center-align the items, we used `place-items: center`. We also made the `#weather-search` element half the width of its parent `#weather-wrapper` element.

Let's save the **styles.css** file now and re-render the page:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/rendered_weather_app_with_css_3.png" alt="Rendered app with even more CSS added" />

Next, we're going to apply some CSS Flexbox to easily center-align the content in our weather app.

Inside the `#weather-wrapper` and `#weather-search` elements, let's add the following:

```css
#weather-wrapper {
  display: flex;
}

#weather-search {
  display: flex;
}
```

Since both `#weather-wrapper` and `#weather-search` contains child elements, `display: flex` turns them into flex containers. The elements in these containers become flex items that we can align with certain properties.

Go ahead and add the following:

```css
#weather-wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  place-items: center;
}

#weather-search {
  display: flex;
  width: 50%;
  gap: 5px;
}
```

By default, flex items are displayed in a row. But we changed this for the `#weather-wrapper` element by setting `flex-direction` to `column`.

To center-align the items, we used `place-items: center`. We also made the `#weather-search` element half the width of its parent `#weather-wrapper` element. Lastly, we maintained that space between the text input and the "Search" button with `gap: 5px`.

Let's save the **styles.css** file now and re-render the page:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/rendered_weather_app_with_css_4.png" alt="Rendered app with final CSS added" />

Excellent! Our app is starting to look good!

In the next step, we will be spending most of it writing JavaScript for our weather app. However, it will involve coming back to style our `#weather-data` element!

## Step 5: Write JavaScript

Remember the submit-type `<input>` element (`#submit`) we created in the last step? It had an `onclick` attribute set to a function called `fetchWeather()`.

In this final step, we are going to write this `fetchWeather()` function! Afterwards, when we type something and search with the “Get Weather" button, this function will execute every time.

### Define Global Variables

Let's open our **script.js** file and start by defining a new `fetchWeather()` function:

```js
function fetchWeather() {

}
```

This function takes no parameters. Next, let's define a few global variables inside the function:

```js
function fetchWeather() {
  let searchInput = document.getElementById("search").value;
  const weatherDataSection = document.getElementById("weather-data");
  weatherDataSection.style.display = "block";
  const apiKey = “REPLACE WITH YOUR API KEY"; 
}
```

In the snippet above, we did the following:

- We created a  `searchInput` variable with the value of `#search` element we selected via `document.getElementById()`.
- We also selected the `#weather-data` element, where our search result will appear.
  - When we first made this element in Step 3, its `display` property was set to none. We changed this to `block` in `fetchWeather()` so the weather data can be seen.
- Lastly, we initialized an `apiKey` variable with a placeholder string. Make sure to replace this with your OpenWeather API Key (from Step 2).

**Note:** Never, ever share your API keys in public to prevent hacking and inappropriate use of API services. If you intend on pushing your tutorial code to a place like GitHub, replace the value of `apiKey` with a comment or empty string.

Since we now have a variable representing the `#weather-data` element, let's add an `if` statement that displays a custom message for empty input with the `innerHTML` property of the `weatherDataSection` variable:

```js
if(searchInput == "") {
  weatherDataSection.innerHTML = `
  <div>
  <h2>Empty Input!</h2>
  <p>Please try again with a valid <u>city name</u>.</p>
  </div>
  `;
  return;
}
```
Next, let's define two inner functions that will help us with getting our weather information.

```js
function fetchWeather() {
  const searchInput = document.getElementById('search').value;

  const apiKey = // REPLACE WITH YOUR API KEY

  async function getLonAndLat() {

  }

  async function getWeatherData(lon, lat) {

  }
}
```

We need these functions to use two separate APIs from OpenWeather:

- One for getting a location's longitude and latitude based on a typed name or zip code.
- One for getting current weather information based on the longitude and latitude.

You may have noticed that these functions have the `async` keyword in front of them. We'll be using the companion `await` keyword, along with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch" target="_blank">`fetch()`</a> function, to ensure we get valid weather information each time.

### Write getLonAndLat() Function

First, let's write the code for the `getLonAndLat()` function that will use OpenWeather's GeoCoding API to return the longitude and latitude data based on our `searchInput`.

For this tutorial, we're only going to search by location. Therefore, the `searchInput` should be a string of a valid location or city name (e.g., “Pittsburgh" or “Brooklyn, NY").

**Note:** But feel free to add more search criteria to this code (e.g., zip code)!

Let's define two variables:

```js
async function getLonAndLat() {
  const countryCode = 1
  geocodeURL = `http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=${searchInput.replace(" ", "%20")},${countryCode}&limit=1&appid=${apiKey}`
}
```

We defined a `countryCode` integer that is needed for the GeoCoding API to work. Next, we made a `geocodeURL` of the API endpoint that includes the `countryCode` along with the `apiKey` we defined earlier.
 
**Note:** The `countryCode` for the U.S. is 1, but yours may be different. Try searching for yours [here](https://countrycode.org/).

To return the longitude and latitude data, we need to fetch it from the API. One way of doing this is with the web-based `fetch()` method.

```js
  const response = await fetch(geocodeURL);
  if(!response.ok) {
    console.log("Bad response! ", response.status);
    return;
  }
```

This returns a response from OpenWeather's API. However, because this data is coming from another computer (probably a server), it may not be returned immediately. Also, the program is allowed to run ahead, even if there is no response yet.

This is why we use `async/await`; the `await`-part prevents the associated `async` function from continuing until response data is returned from `fetch()`. We then store this in a `response` variable. If its HTTP status is anything but 200 or “good" (i.e., `!response.ok`), then an error message is logged and nothing is returned.

Next, we want to get the actual geocode data in JSON (or JavaScript Object Notation). We can use the `response` object's `.json()` to do this! And since the data is coming from the response, this is returned asynchronously and so we must use the `await` keyword:

```js
  const data = await response.json();
```

Similar to what we did for a case where the `searchInput` is empty, let's add a conditional statement for how what the app should display based on the value of `data`:

```js
  if(data.length == 0) {
    console.log("Something went wrong here.");
    weatherDataSection.innerHTML = `
    <div>
    <h2>Invalid Input: "${searchInput}"</h2>
    <p>Please try again with a valid <u>city name</u>.</p>
    </div>
    `;
    return;
  } else {
    return data[0];
  }
```

If our API call for the longitude and latitude didn't go as planned, our `data` should be returned as an empty array and an error message will be rendered, instead. Otherwise, there should be a JSON object stored as the first element and we'll return that in the `else` clause.

### Write getWeatherData() Function

Let's now write code for the `getWeatherData()` function. This accepts a `lon` and `lat` parameter that will be used in the API call for the current weather data. We will have gotten this information from the `getLonAndLat()` function we defined earlier.

The `getWeatherData()` function will also work with response data from the `fetch()` function. Therefore, this function also gets the `async` keyword.

This function is a little more straightforward. First, we'll define a `weatherURL` and assign the other OpenWeather endpoint:

```js
const weatherURL = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}&appid=${apiKey}`
```

Next, we'll define a `response` variable and assign to it the object returned by the `fetch()` function with the `weatherURL` passed in. If there's a problem, we'll print an error message and return nothing. Otherwise, we'll press on and make another `data` object with the JSON object for the current weather data.

**Note:** Don't forget the `await` keyword for the `response` and `data` variables!

```js
const response = await fetch(weatherURL);
if(!response.ok) {
  console.log("Bad response! ", response.status);
  return;
}

const data = await response.json();
```

### Display Weather Data

For this next part, we'll finish work inside of the `getWeatherData()` function, as well as in the outer `fetchWeather()` function. We'll be displaying the `data` information we just got to our HTML file. Then, we'll get to actually see the requested API data displayed on the browser!

Using the weather information from the `data` variable, let's do the following with the `weatherDataSection`:

```js
  weatherDataSection.innerHTML = `
  <img src="https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${data.weather[0].icon}.png" alt="${data.weather[0].description}" width="100" />
  <div>
  <h2>${data.name}</h2>
  <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> ${Math.round(data.main.temp - 273.15)}°C</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> ${data.weather[0].description}</p>
  </div>
  `
```

We used the `.innerHTML` property to assign some new HTML to the `#weather-data` element, such as:

- `data.weather[0].icon` for an image representation of the current weather.
- `data.name` for the location/city.
- `data.main.temp` for the temperature (measured in [Kelvins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin) by default, hence the rounding).
- `data.weather[0].description` for a brief description of the current weather.

We are now finished with writing the `getWeatherData()` function! But now, we need to actually use the functions we just defined to finish writing the outer `fetchWeather()` function.

Near the closing curly brace `}` of the `fetchWeather()` function, let's add the following:

```js
document.getElementbyId("search").value = "";
const geocodeData = await getLonAndLat();
getWeatherData(geocodeData.lon, geocodeData.lat);
```

- First, we reset the value of the `searchInput` to an empty string so that the text input is cleared on the app after searching.
- Next, we defined a `geocodeData` variable with the longitude and latitude data returned by the `getLonAndLat()` function.
- Lastly, we simply invoked the `getWeatherData()` function and passed in the `.lon` and `.lat` properties of the `geocodeData` variable.

Since the data returned by `getLonAndLat()` is asynchronous response data, we placed an `await` keyword before it. Therefore, we need to add the `async` keyword to our outer `fetchWeather()` function:

```js
async function fetchWeather() {
  // Rest of code below
}
```

Let's save **script.js** and see what our rendered app now does when searching:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/finished_weather_app.gif" alt="Finished Weather Application" />

### Style Weather Data

We're almost finished!

There are just a few last things to do for both the CSS and JavaScript of this project. Our `#weather-data` element is behaving as expected, but now let's style it a bit more!

First, let's make it so the weather information is placed beside the weather icon. We can do this by changing the `display` property of the `weatherDataSection` variable from `"block"` to `"flex"`:

```js
  weatherDataSection.style.display = "flex";
  weatherDataSection.innerHTML = `
  <img src="https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${data.weather[0].icon}.png" alt="${data.weather[0].description}" width="100" />
  <div>
  <h2>${data.name}</h2>
  <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> ${Math.round(data.main.temp - 273.15)}°C</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> ${data.weather[0].description}</p>
  </div>
  `
```

We made the `#weather-data` element a flex container with JavaScript code… wow!

Next, let's save **script.js** and re-open the **styles.css** file, and add the following to the bottom:

```css
#weather-data {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85);
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 1.5em;
  margin-top: 20px;

  text-align: center;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 12px;
}

#weather-data > img {
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: lightskyblue;
}
```

In the snippet above, we added some more styles to the `#weather-data` element, including:

- A `background-color` that is semi-transparent (`rgba()`).
- Some box layer settings for `border-radius`, `padding`, and `margin-top`.
- Center-aligned text.
- A few Flexbox-centric properties that align the icon and weather info towards the center and puts a little gap between them.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, we are now finished with building our weather application!

Let's go ahead and save our **styles.css** file one last time! Refresh the rendered page and try typing in your favorite city:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/projects/main/projects/view-weather-with-html-css-js/finished_weather_app.gif" alt="Finished Weather Application" />

Using the three building blocks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we were able to build a functional application that uses some deep frontend and backend elements such as:

- Asynchronous programming with API data and web-based functions like `fetch()`.
- Arranging content via CSS Flexbox.
- Manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) with `document.getElementById()`.

How would you build upon this application? Some ideas could be adding more data like humidity and wind/gust speed, or including a 5- or 10-day forecast.
